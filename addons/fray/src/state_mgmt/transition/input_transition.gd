extends FrayStateMachineTransition
## Abstract input based transition class.
##
## Accepts input dictionary that contains these entires:
## [br] [br]
## - [code]time_since_last_input[/code] is the time in seconds since the last input was provided, as a [float].

## Minimum time that must have elapsed since the last input, in seconds. If negative then this check is ignored.
