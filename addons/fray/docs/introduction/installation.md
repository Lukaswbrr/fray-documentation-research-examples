# Installation

::: warning
**Fray is currently in an alpha state.**

What does this mean?

- It has not been tested rigorously enough for me to be comfortable recommending it for use in a serious project.

- The documentation is incomplete and there is a lack of good examples.

- Lastly, it is still susceptible to refactors, meaning the API is subject to change.

That being said, a significant portion of Fray is functional, with any remaining bugs likely being simple oversights rather than major design flaws. If these issues do not concern you, and/or you are interested in testing the framework, please feel free to explore!
