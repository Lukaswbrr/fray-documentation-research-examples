# What is Fray?

`Fray` is a modular Godot 4 addon designed to aid in the development of action-oriented games. It offers solutions for combatant state management, complex input detection, input buffering, and hitbox organization. If your project requires any of these functionalities you may benefit from using Fray.

## Modular Design

Fray is structured into three modules: State Management, Input, and Hit. These modules operate independently and communicate solely through strings, offering the flexibility to replace Fray's solutions with your own and using only what you need.
